        <h3>What is Fantasy Football?</h3>
        <p>Fantasy Football is a game where you act as the manager of a NFL team.
          You get to call the shots on who is on your team and when they are playing.
          You are competing against other owners in your league by trying to score the most
          points based on the performance of your players in the real NFL game.

          <h4>How are points scored?</h4>
          <p>Players are given points based on performance statistics from their real-life games.</p>
          <p>So the <b>Quarter Back</b> has multiple chances of earning points by passing yards, passing touchdowns,
            rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns. The quarter back can also lose points by throwing interceptions or
            fumbles.
